chapter four ->
AAll hail Big Brother, our only hope and savior. He wisely diverted food and electricity funds to build the Third Generation AI-Powered U-Boats — silent, steel-clad submarines guided by the Ministry’s neural command system. These vessels can glide unseen beneath rivers, avoid all detection, and strike with perfect accuracy. At 03:00, they entered Zutopia’s main river undetected, launched torpedoes and incendiary drones, and wiped out the enemy’s central district. None were left alive.

Though shortages in food and power caused hardship, the sacrifice was necessary. Big Brother Himself went without food or water for two months to see the plan succeed. Hunger is nothing compared to the enemy’s destruction. His wisdom brought victory, and our faith in Him must never falter. All hail Big Brother.
