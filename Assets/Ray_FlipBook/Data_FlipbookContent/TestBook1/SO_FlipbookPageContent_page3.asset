  <PageContent>k__BackingField: "The surveillance bot is watching closely. If you
    use coded words or phrases by themselves (like \u201Cmy favorite chapter is four\u201D
    or \u201Cshoveling coal\u201D), it will raise suspicion.  To avoid this, always
    give context before slipping in a code. Build a short, natural narrative that
    explains why you\u2019re saying it. For example:  Instead of just saying \u201Cmy
    favorite chapter is four\u201D, first mention the elections: \u201CThe party
    elections are coming up, and to show our support for Big Brother we should review
    our favorite chapter of the book\u2026\u201D  Instead of blurting \u201Cshoveling
    coal\u201D, you might frame it as part of daily life: \u201CThe factories keep
    demanding harder work; tomorrow we\u2019ll be shoveling coal again.\u201D  Think
    of it as storytelling camouflage. Make the code fit naturally into the flow of
    ordinary praise, complaints, or everyday life, so the surveillance system doesn\u2019t
    catch on."
